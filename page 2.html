       <p class="About">This person is essentially the group leader and is responsible for managing the production from start to
            finish. The producer develops the project from the initial idea, makes sure the script is finalized, arranges the financing
             and manages the production team that makes the film.<br>The producer also coordinates the filmmaking process to ensure that 
             everyone involved in the project is working on schedule and on budget. Without the producer at the helm, films do not get made.</p>
